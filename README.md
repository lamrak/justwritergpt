# Project "Just Writer"

This project is an innovative application that leverages the power of ChatGPT to provide users with concise and personalized descriptions based on their input. By allowing users to enter a few keywords or phrases, the application generates a short description that incorporates those keywords, providing a tailored and engaging experience.
This project is a modular application that utilizes modern technologies such as Ð¡oroutines, Jetpack Compose, and ChatGPT API to create a high-performance and interactive application. Below you will find a description of the architecture and key components of the project.

## Architecture

The project is built using a modular Clean Architecture, which allows for logical separation of functionality into individual modules. Each module is responsible for a specific functional block of the application and has its own responsibilities and dependencies. This promotes improved scalability, testability, and maintainability of the project.

## Usage of Coroutines

Coroutines are used in the project to provide asynchronous behavior and manage parallel execution of tasks. Coroutines are lightweight and efficient mechanisms that enable the execution of long-running operations without blocking the main thread. They provide a convenient way to handle asynchronous operations, handle errors, and manage the results effectively.

## Usage of Jetpack Compose

Jetpack Compose, a declarative UI toolkit for Android, is used to create the user interface. It allows for describing the appearance and behavior of components using Kotlin code, making UI development and maintenance easier. With Jetpack Compose, it is quick to create responsive and modern interfaces with minimal effort.
